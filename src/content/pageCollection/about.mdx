## Overview

In the beginning, Wordpress was the *defacto* content management tool. Now, 20-something years later, you may not need Wordpress. In fact, your site could be less expensive to run, and more secure without it. The purpose of this tutorial is to migrate your current Wordpress content into a markdown CMS (Content Management System). The CMS includes a WYSIWYG (What You See Is What You Get) toolbar, therefore, no knowledge of markdown is required. Although, you'll soon realize markdown is a super simple, flexible language to comprehend.

Understand, this approach might not be for everyone. If you are a writer who mostly writes long form content, then stick around. Regardless, this tutorial will intentionally try to avoid using the Terminal or CLI (Command Line Interface). 

The setup instructions will cover running the CMS locally, although it's possible to edit content remotely, too.

## Requirements 

Don't feel deterred by the number of software packages and accounts required for this tutorial. My goal is to be thorough, therefore, inclusive for almost everyone. 

### Software

The software required to run this CMS is free and/or open source.

#### [WP Gatsby Markdown Exporter](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-gatsby-markdown-exporter/)

A plugin for Wordpress which makes exporting your content a breeze. Don't be fooled by its name. Ignore the warning for not being compliant with Wordpress 6.4.x. This plugin still works today. It exports pages, posts, or other post types as markdown files. 

#### [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org)

The software package is necessary to test and preview your site on your local computer. Install the LTS version, or at least version 20.x.x. 

#### [Github Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/)

A nice GUI (Graphic User Interface) for authenticating changes and revisions with your project. Using this app, instead, avoids trips to the CLI.

#### [Microsoft Visual Studio (VS Code)](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

Although, this software might be targeted at developers, with predefined settings along with the help of the FrontMatter extension, VS Code will look more simplified and comprehensible.

#### [FrontMatter for VS Code](https://frontmatter.codes/)

This brilliant extension helps turn VS Code into a visual CMS by adding a dashboard, content fields, live preview, and more. 

### Accounts

The services below are free, or offer a generous free tier. Personally, I never had to pay for either service.

#### [Github](https://github.com/)

Github will be used to store and manage content, and track changes. 

#### [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/)

Netlify will be used to deploy your project to the world. Netlify automatically serves your content over a CDN (Content Delivery Network), which simply means, your content loads closest to your visitor. 

When ever changes are made to your project and published, Netlify will automatically regenerate your website. 

### Project Theme

#### *Twenty Something* Theme

The *Twenty Something* theme serves as a jumping-off point. VS Code's project settings, FrontMatter's configuration, and project setup are all defined. This theme leverages [Astro](https://astro.build/) in a big way.

## Getting Started

### Wordpress Preparation

Install and activate the [*WP Gatsby Markdown Exporter*]((https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-gatsby-markdown-exporter/)) plugin in your Wordpress Site.

Find and press the *Export to Gatsby* link in the sidebar.

On the **Export to Gatsby** settings screen: 

   1. Make sure the *posts* and *pages* post types' checkboxes have been ticked.  
   2. Find the *Export date format* field. The format needs to be changed to `Y-m-d`.  
   3. Under *Exclude fields*, add `id`, `footnotes`, and `post_format`.
   4. Under *Change field name*, add `permalink,slug`, and on the next line  `excerpt,description`.
   5. Tick the box next to *Create post type directories*. 
   6. Change any other options that might be specific to your site. 
   7. Press the button, *Download zip file*, and save to your device. 

After unzipping the file, you should see `post`, `page` and `uploads` directories. 

Notice a lack of an `author` post type? Adding `author` content will be addressed further on in this tutorial. 

Opening one of the `post` markdown files should appear similar to the following: 

```markdown
---
title: 'Hello world!'
date: 2024-01-23
status: publish
author: john-doe
type: post
thumbnail: ../../uploads/2024/01/fpo-image.jpg
category:
  - News
tag: 
  - updates
slug: /hello-world
description: 'Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.'
---

And Hello to You!
-----------------

Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua. Ut enim ad minim veniam, quis nostrud exercitation ullamco laboris nisi ut aliquip ex ea commodo consequat. Duis aute irure dolor in reprehenderit in voluptate velit esse cillum dolore eu fugiat nulla pariatur. 

![a city landscape in the rain](../../uploads/2024/01/fpo-image.jpg)

Excepteur sint occaecat cupidatat non proident, sunt in culpa qui officia deserunt mollit anim id est laborum.
```

There are a couple fields that aren't exported by the plugin. In order for images to be transformed by Astro, they need to reside in the `assets` directory. 

Use VS Code's global find/replace feature.  
In VS Code's top menu, press *Edit*, then select the *Replace in Files* item.  

Search: `../../uploads`  
Replace: `../../assets/uploads`

The `slug` field will also require modification. Essentially, the absolute path needs to be removed. Once again, utilize *Replace in Files*.

Search: `slug: /`  
Replace: `slug: `

<Callout variant="caution" title="Alert">
Be sure to include a space after the colon in *slug*.
</Callout>


### Install NodeJS

NodeJS is required to run a preview of the site locally. Install it onto your device by choosing the appropriate installer for your operating system.  
[List of installers](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

Be sure to choose the LTS version, or at least Node version 20.x.x.

### Prep for Git

1. Register for a free Github account. [Account signup](https://github.com/signup) 
2. Download and install Github Desktop. [Download installer](https://desktop.github.com/)

### Set Up the Theme

1. Port the *Twenty Something* theme template over to your Github account. [Visit the theme repo](https://github.com/djmtype/twenty-something) 
4. Find and press *Use this template* and select *Create a new repository*. You'll be directed to a page to create a new repository under your account. 
5. In the *Repository Name* field, enter *twenty something*. Press the *Create repository* button. Upon success, you'll be redirected to your own *Twenty Something* repo.
6. Find and press the *Code* button. Under the *Local* tab, select the *Open with Github Desktop* item. You'll be prompt to save *twenty-something* to a location on your device.

<Callout type="info" title="Info">Regardless of the name you give to your repository, `twenty-something` will be used throughout this tutorial.</Callout>

### Set Up Visual Studio Code

1. Install [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) from Microsoft.
2. With VS Code open, go to the top menu, select *File > Open Folder*, and select `twenty-something` folder from your device. 
3. Add the FrontMatter extension if you weren't prompted to install. In VS Code's top menu, select *View > Extensions*. Search for *Front Matter CMS*, and enable it. 
4. Install the theme's dependencies.  
This is the only one time you'll need to use VS Code's Terminal.  
   - From the top menu, select *View > Terminal*. 
   - Inside the Terminal, type `npm i` followed by the <kbd>RETURN</kbd> key.

If everything was a success, you should see a similar screenshot as shown below. 

*A couple dummy posts, pages, and authors have been added for illustrative purposes.*

### Transport Files

The files you exported earlier from Wordpress can be moved to the corresponding directories inside your `twenty-something` folder within the `src` directory as illustrated below. 

```
/
├── src/
│   ├── assets/
│   │   ├── uploads/
│   ├── content/
│   │   ├── page/
│   │   ├── post/
│   │   ├── author/
```

Since the *WP Gatsby Markdown Exporter* doesn't add author information to the export, these files must be added manually. Follow the `john-doe.md` example inside `/src/content/author`. 

Author names defined in any `author` field must be typed as lowercase, kebab format. Use a hyphen in place of a space.

---

## Manage Content

Upon opening VS Code, FrontMatter's Dashboard should be shown. Press the *FM* icon in the left sidebar if it isn't preselected. From the Dashboard, open a page or post by selecting it.

Now find the *Metadata* panel in the sidebar. FrontMatter provides a helpful user interface for the corresponding fields declared within the markdown files. These fields should seem similar to Wordpress such as *title*, *date*, *category*, etc.

There are a number of ways to return to the FrontMatter's Dashboard. 

Press the *FrontMatter Dashboard* tab;  
or press the smaller *FM* icon located within the sidebar, on top;  
or use the keyboard shortcut: <kbd>OPTION/ALT</kbd> + <kbd>D</kbd>

### Get Acquainted with the Dashboard

At the top of the Dashboard are several tabs: 

- **Contents** essentially reveals all the markdown files. 
- **Media** displays all files within the `assets` directory. In order to modify metadata of an image, hover over the vertical ellipsis and press the pencil icon. From there, it is possible to set the alternative text, and add a caption if needed. 
- **Data** is where all the global site settings can be managed – including the overall configuration and primary navigation.
- **Snippets** are a pre-defined chunk of code/text that can be used to insert in your content. 
- **Taxonomies** reveal all the terms for categories and tags found within your markdown files. They can also be managed here. For example, modifying any category or tag term will automatically update across every file. 

### Get Acquainted with the Editor

FrontMatter provides a handy WYSIWYG toolbar displayed on top of each document for styling text, adding links, inserting snippets, etc. Otherwise, learning markdown will really speed up your writing.  [Cheatsheet for Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/)

For more than text and images, pre-defined components can be added to your page. Components are akin to Wordpress shortcodes. While shortcodes are written inside square brackets, components are written inside angled brackets. 

Example of a Wordpress *ButtonLink* shortcode: 

```html
[ButtonLink variant="primary" href="https://website.com"]My Button[/ButtonLink]
```

Example of a *ButtonLink* component: 

```html
<ButtonLink variant="primary" href="https://website.com">My Button</ButtonLink>
```

There are a few predefined components provided with this theme. They can be accessed from FrontMatter's toolbar. Pressing on the scissors button will direct you to the *Snippets* area. Adding any of the snippets will place the corresponding component's markup into your file.

<Callout variant="info">Components are always written in `PascalCase`; not to be be confused with traditional HTML elements which are written in `lowercase`.</Callout>

### Launch a Preview

In order to see a rendered view of your markdown file, launch the simple browser. 

1. Press the FrontMatter icon in the left sidebar.
2. Find and expand the *Actions* panel in the sidebar. 
3. Press the *Start server* button. 
4. Open a post from FrontMatter's Dashboard. 
5. Within the *Actions* panel, press the *Open preview* button. 

A live preview of the opened post should display next to the markdown file. Try modifying content inside the markdown file. Saving the file should update the live preview. 

<Callout variant="caution" title="Attention">
When previewing other markdown files, it is necessary to press the *Open preview* button for each file.
</Callout>

## Deployment

### Connect to Netlify
In order to publish your site, you'll need a server. We'll be using Netlify in this instance.

1. Visit [Netlify.com](https://netlify.com).
2. Press the *Sign up* button.
3. Press the *Sign up with Github* button.
4. Enter your Github account credentials, press the *Sign in* button, and grant Netlify access if required.
5. After you have access to Netlify, press the *Sites* link in the sidebar.
6. Press the *Add new site* button. Select *Import an existing project* from the popup menu.
7. Press *Deploy with Github* button. Authorize Netlify to access your repositories.
8. Select your `twenty-something` repo.
9. Press the *Deploy twenty-something* button.

<Callout variant="info" title="More Help">Read the [*Add a new site* section](https://docs.netlify.com/welcome/add-new-site/#import-from-an-existing-repository) from Netlify's documentation if some instructions were unclear or outdated.</Callout>

#### Rename the Netlify Domain

Feel free to change the auto-generated url provided by Netlify. 

1. Visit the *Domain management* link in the sidebar.
2. Press the *Options* button, select *Edit site name*.  
A popup should be revealed with an input. Enter a new name and press *Save*.

#### Add a Custom Domain

It's also possible to apply a custom domain, one without `*.netlify.app`. 

Still on the *Domain management* page, press the *Add a domain* button. Enter and verify your pre-owned domain name.

Next, modify your DNS records with your registrar, whether it be NameCheap, GoDaddy, or whomever. 

Add `A` and `CNAME` records. Obviously, replace `custom-name` with your own details.

In brief, the `A` record points your domain at Netlify's server IP address. And the `CNAME` is an alias for anyone visiting `www.custom-name.com`.

| Type  | Name                 | Content
|:------|:---------------------|:------------------------
| A     | custom-name.com      | 75.2.60.5
| CNAME | www                  | custom-name.netlify.app

<Callout variant="info" title="Info">It could take up to 48 hours for the DNS records to propagate.</Callout>

### Publish Changes

These next steps will be used whenever content has been modified, and you want changes reflected on your website. 

1. Open *Github Desktop*.
2. Select `twenty-something` as the current repository.  
For any reason, should `twenty-something` not be shown in *Github Desktop*, select `File > Add Local Repository` from its menu.
3. If there are changes to be made, fill out the required *Summary* field.
4. Press the *Commit to…* button.
5. Press the *Push origin* button.

All changes will be sent off to Netlify. Soon after, those updates will make their way to your website. It may take a few moments depending on the amount of files.
