## Wordpress Preparation

Install and activate the [*WP Gatsby Markdown Exporter*]((https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-gatsby-markdown-exporter/)) plugin in your Wordpress Site.

Find and press the *Export to Gatsby* link in the sidebar.

On the **Export to Gatsby** settings screen: 

   1. Make sure the *posts* and *pages* post types' checkboxes have been ticked.  
   2. Find the *Export date format* field. The format needs to be changed to `Y-m-d`.  
   3. Under *Exclude fields*, add `id`, `footnotes`, and `post_format`.
   4. Under *Change field name*, add `permalink,slug`, and on the next line  `excerpt,description`.
   5. Tick the box next to *Create post type directories*. 
   6. Change any other options that might be specific to your site. 
   7. Press the button, *Download zip file*, and save to your device. 

After unzipping the file, you should see `post`, `page` and `uploads` directories. 

Notice a lack of an `author` post type? Adding `author` content will be addressed further on in this tutorial. 

Opening one of the `post` markdown files should appear similar to the following: 

```markdown
---
title: 'Hello world!'
date: 2024-01-23
status: publish
author: john-doe
type: post
thumbnail: ../../uploads/2024/01/fpo-image.jpg
category:
  - News
tag: 
  - updates
slug: /hello-world
description: 'Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.'
---

And Hello to You!
-----------------

Excepteur sint occaecat cupidatat non proident, sunt in culpa qui officia deserunt mollit anim id est laborum.
```

There are a couple fields that aren't exported by the plugin. In order for images to be transformed by Astro, they need to reside in the `assets` directory. 

Use VS Code's global find/replace feature.  
In VS Code's top menu, press *Edit*, then select the *Replace in Files* item.  

Search: `../../uploads`  
Replace: `../../assets/uploads`

The `slug` field will also require modification. Essentially, the absolute path needs to be removed. Once again, utilize *Replace in Files*.

Search: `slug: /`  
Replace: `slug: `

<Callout variant="caution" title="Alert">
Be sure to include a space after the colon in *slug*.

## Install NodeJS

NodeJS is required to run a preview of the site locally. Install it onto your device by choosing the appropriate installer for your operating system.  
[List of installers](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

Be sure to choose the LTS version, or at least Node version 20.x.x.

## Prepare for Git

1. Register for a free Github account. [Account signup](https://github.com/signup) 
2. Download and install Github Desktop. [Download installer](https://desktop.github.com/)

## Set Up the Theme

1. Port the *Twenty Something* theme template over to your Github account. [Visit the theme repo](https://github.com/djmtype/twenty-something) 
4. Find and press *Use this template* and select *Create a new repository*. You'll be directed to a page to create a new repository under your account. 
5. In the *Repository Name* field, enter *twenty something*. Press the *Create repository* button. Upon success, you'll be redirected to your own *Twenty Something* repo.
6. Find and press the *Code* button. Under the *Local* tab, select the *Open with Github Desktop* item. You'll be prompt to save *twenty-something* to a location on your device.

<Callout variant="info" title="Info">
Regardless of the name you give to your repository, `twenty-something` will be used throughout this tutorial.
</Callout>

## Set Up Visual Studio Code

1. Install [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) from Microsoft.
2. With VS Code open, go to the top menu, select *File > Open Folder*, and select `twenty-something` folder from your device. 
3. Add the FrontMatter extension if you weren't prompted to install. In VS Code's top menu, select *View > Extensions*. Search for *Front Matter CMS*, and enable it. 
4. Install the theme's dependencies.  
This is the only one time you'll need to use VS Code's Terminal.  
   - From the top menu, select *View > Terminal*. 
   - Inside the Terminal, type `npm i` followed by the <kbd>RETURN</kbd> key.

If everything was a success, you should see a similar screenshot as shown below. 

*A couple dummy posts, pages, and authors have been added for illustrative purposes.*

## Transport Files

The files you exported earlier from Wordpress can be moved to the corresponding directories inside your `twenty-something` folder within the `src` directory as illustrated below. 

```
/
├── src/
│   ├── assets/
│   │   ├── uploads/
│   ├── content/
│   │   ├── page/
│   │   ├── post/
│   │   ├── author/
```

Since the *WP Gatsby Markdown Exporter* doesn't add author information to the export, these files must be added manually. Follow the `john-doe.md` example inside `/src/content/author`. 

Author names defined in any `author` field must be typed as lowercase, kebab format. Use a hyphen in place of a space.
