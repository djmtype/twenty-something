## Connect to Netlify
In order to publish your site, you'll need a server. We'll be using Netlify in this instance.

1. Visit [Netlify.com](https://netlify.com).
2. Press the *Sign up* button.
3. Press the *Sign up with Github* button.
4. Enter your Github account credentials, press the *Sign in* button, and grant Netlify access if required.
5. After you have access to Netlify, press the *Sites* link in the sidebar.
6. Press the *Add new site* button. Select *Import an existing project* from the popup menu.
7. Press *Deploy with Github* button. Authorize Netlify to access your repositories.
8. Select your `twenty-something` repo.
9. Press the *Deploy twenty-something* button.

<Callout variant="info" title="More Help">Read the [*Add a new site* section](https://docs.netlify.com/welcome/add-new-site/#import-from-an-existing-repository) from Netlify's documentation if some instructions were unclear or outdated.</Callout>

### Rename the Netlify Domain

Feel free to change the auto-generated url provided by Netlify. 

1. Visit the *Domain management* link in the sidebar.
2. Press the *Options* button, select *Edit site name*.  
A popup should be revealed with an input. Enter a new name and press *Save*.

### Add a Custom Domain

It's also possible to apply a custom domain, one without `*.netlify.app`. 

Still on the *Domain management* page, press the *Add a domain* button. Enter and verify your pre-owned domain name.

Next, modify your DNS records with your registrar, whether it be NameCheap, GoDaddy, or whomever. 

Add `A` and `CNAME` records. Obviously, replace `custom-name` with your own details.

In brief, the `A` record points your domain at Netlify's server IP address. And the `CNAME` is an alias for anyone visiting `www.custom-name.com`.

| Type  | Name                 | Content
|:------|:---------------------|:------------------------
| A     | custom-name.com      | 75.2.60.5
| CNAME | www                  | custom-name.netlify.app

<Callout variant="info" title="Info">It could take up to 48 hours for the DNS records to propagate.</Callout>

## Publish Changes

These next steps will be used whenever content has been modified, and you want changes reflected on your website. 

1. Open *Github Desktop*.
2. Select `twenty-something` as the current repository.  
For any reason, should `twenty-something` not be shown in *Github Desktop*, select `File > Add Local Repository` from its menu.
3. If there are changes to be made, fill out the required *Summary* field.
4. Press the *Commit toâ€¦* button.
5. Press the *Push origin* button.

All changes will be sent off to Netlify. Soon after, those updates will make their way to your website. It may take a few moments depending on the amount of files.
