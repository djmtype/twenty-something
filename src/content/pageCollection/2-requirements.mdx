Don't feel deterred by the number of software packages and accounts required for this tutorial. My goal is to be thorough, therefore, inclusive for almost everyone. 

### Software

The software required to run this CMS is free and/or open source.

<details>
<summary>
#### WP Gatsby Markdown Exporter
</summary>

A plugin for Wordpress which makes exporting your content a breeze. Don't be fooled by its name. Ignore the warning for not being compliant with Wordpress 6.4.x. This plugin still works today. It exports pages, posts, or other post types as markdown files.

#### NodeJS
</summary>

The software package is necessary to test and preview your site on your local computer. Install the LTS version, or at least version 20.x.x.

<summary>
#### Github Desktop
</summary>

A nice GUI (Graphic User Interface) for authenticating changes and revisions with your project. Using this app, instead, avoids trips to the CLI.

<summary>
#### Visual Studio Code (VS Code)
</summary>

Although, this software might be targeted at developers, with predefined settings along with the help of the FrontMatter extension, VS Code will look more simplified and comprehensible.

#### Front Matter
</summary>

This brilliant extension helps turn VS Code into a visual CMS by adding a dashboard, content fields, live preview, and more.

### Accounts

The services below are free, or offer a generous free tier. Personally, I never had to pay for either service.

<details>
<summary>
#### Github
</summary>

Github will be used to store and manage content, and track changes.

#### Netlify
</summary>

Netlify will be used to deploy your project to the world. Netlify automatically serves your content over a CDN (Content Delivery Network), which simply means, your content loads closest to your visitor. 

When ever changes are made to your project and published, Netlify will automatically regenerate your website.

### Project Theme

<details>
<summary>
#### *Twenty Something* Theme
</summary>

The *Twenty Something* theme serves as a jumping-off point. VS Code's project settings, FrontMatter's configuration, and project setup are all defined. This theme leverages [Astro](https://astro.build/) in a big way.
