In the beginning, Wordpress was the *defacto* content management tool. Now, 20-something years later, you may not need Wordpress. In fact, your site could be less expensive to run, and more secure without it. The purpose of this tutorial is to migrate your current Wordpress content into a markdown CMS (Content Management System). The CMS includes a WYSIWYG (What You See Is What You Get) toolbar, therefore, no knowledge of markdown is required. Although, you'll soon realize markdown is a super simple, flexible language to comprehend.

Understand, this approach might not be for everyone. If you are a writer who mostly writes long form content, then stick around. Regardless, this tutorial will intentionally try to avoid using the Terminal or CLI (Command Line Interface). 

The setup instructions will cover running the CMS locally, although it's possible to edit content remotely, too.
